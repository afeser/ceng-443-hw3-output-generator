# Description

For input generation please refer to the original repository. I am just writing a tester script to test for many input/output pairs automatically.

Put `AA.java` file into your source directory, it contains the static main method. `student_course.txt` and `input.7z` should be directly readable. The results will be stored in `test_result.txt` whereas my results are in `test_result_compare.txt`. You can simply compare it with diff command or another utility.

Any fix, bug report etc. are welcome. Hope all get 100 points :)
